I believe the most important thing in software engineering is understanding concepts that can be applied to any stack. I started my career with an intern that then turned into a full time job doing basic html/css/js. After moving to Michigan, I did consulting for a large consulting company. This allowed me to dip my toes into a lot of different things includeing databases, chat bots, and project management. Moving to North Dakota, I worked for a News company that allowed me the opporunity to work with a lot of different technologies I had never worked with before, including implementing a user management platfrom and a paywall.",
